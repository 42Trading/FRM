* a better pronounced behaviour
* market highs and lows are better captured
* better spread between the extreme values
* more stability over different companies but still different and individual characterization
* clear correlation with the Lambda structure
* incorporates the whole market volatility and not only the Betas and Lambdas from L1-Q-regression
* shows also the volatility and uncertainty of the CoVaR of any given company/asset
* Many interesting other features waiting for being analysed, investigated and evaluated ...
